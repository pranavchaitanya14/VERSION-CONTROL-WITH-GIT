# Version Control with Git – Manual Demonstration Using GitHub Website

1. Created a new Git repository directly from the GitHub website.
2. Added an initial file using the default README.
3. Created two branches (feature-1 and feature-2) using the GitHub branch dropdown.
4. Modified the same file differently in each branch to intentionally create a conflict.
5. Created a pull request from feature-1 to main and merged successfully.
6. Created another pull request from feature-2 to main, which resulted in a merge conflict.
7. Used GitHub’s built-in “Resolve Conflicts” editor to manually edit and fix the conflict.
8. Committed the resolved version and completed the merge.
9. Repository now contains clear commit history, branches, merges, and documentation.
